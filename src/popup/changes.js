<h3>üö® Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Canvas Code Syntax Synchronization ${issue(94)}: </strong></br></br> 
	When changing themes using the <code>GPThemes floating button</code>, the Canvas <code>CodeMirror</code> editor's syntax highlighting doesn't update immediately, remaining in the previous theme's syntax style, while the app theme changes. This creates a temporary visual inconsistency that can be resolved by <code>refreshing the page</code>.
	<li>Note that changing themes through <code>ChatGPT Settings</code> works correctly without need for page refresh.</li>
	<li>I'm working on a solution to avoid the need for page refresh.</li>
</ul>
